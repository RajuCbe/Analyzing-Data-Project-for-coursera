Project Description:
This project aims to conduct data analysis in the context of the fictional company Mint Classics. I will be playing the role of a novice data analyst assisting the company in addressing inventory and storage facility-related issues. The problem at hand involves the decision to close one of the existing storage facilities.

The Business Task :
	Explore products currently in inventory.
	Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
	Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.
	Formulating Recommendations to Address Business Issues.

Guiding Questions  :
1. Are there products with high inventory but low sales? How can we optimize the inventory of these products?
2. Are all the warehouses currently in use still necessary? How can we review warehouses with low or inactive inventory?
3. Is there a relationship between product prices and their sales levels? How can price adjustments impact sales?
4. Who are the customers contributing the most to sales? How can we focus sales efforts on these valuable customers?
5. How can sales employee performance be evaluated using sales data?
6. How can customer payment trends be analyzed? What credit risks should be monitored, and how can cash flow be managed?
7. How can the performance of various product lines be compared? Which products are the most successful, and which ones need improvement or removal?
8. How can the company's credit policies be evaluated? Are there customers with credit issues that need to be addressed?
